<h1>Felipe Xavier Buson</h1>

<p>Welcome to my homepage</p>

<p>I've decided I have enough things I want to share with other people, so I made a website to host all that.</p>

<h2>
    BiopartsDB
</h2>

<p>
    BiopartsDB is the main product of my master's thesis (except for the thesis itself) at the University of Edinburgh.
    It's a curated repository of synthetic biology parts libraries, with a bunch of the ones that I considered well-characterized enough.
</p>
<p>
    The premise here is that synthetic biology parts are subject to too many variables from experiment to experiment, so parts from different works cannot be compared.
    Therefore, only big parts libraries can give you reliable quantitative information when comparing two different parts.
