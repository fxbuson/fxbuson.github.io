<h1>Felipe Xavier Buson</h1>
  
<p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
  
<p>I've decided I have enough things I want to share with other people, so I made a website to host all that.</p>

<p>Please find the links to my other pages on the navbar.</p>

            <h2>BiopartsDB</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p>
                BiopartsDB is the main product of my master's thesis (except for the thesis itself) at the University of Edinburgh.
                It's a curated repository of synthetic biology parts libraries, with a bunch of the ones that I considered well-characterized enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                The premise here is that synthetic biology parts are subject to too many variables from experiment to experiment, so parts from different works cannot be compared.
                Therefore, only big parts libraries can give you reliable quantitative information when comparing two different parts.

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p>
                As part of my work at the Open Bioeconomy Lab and alongside the OpenPlant initiative, I made a website full of tutorials and protocols for using the Opentrons OT-2 robot.
                All the protocols tutorials are really simple, but were most of what I needed to handle the Reclone collections we distributed from the lab.

            <p>
                I've made a bunch of games during the years that have greatly contributed to my skills in programming.

            <h2>Phyrexian Dictionary</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p>
                Phyrexian is a constructed language (conlang) created by Wizards of the Coast for a fictional world as part of their stories in the Magic: the Gathering card game.
                They introduced teh language in altered verisons of some cards, but without any translation guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a lot of effort by the MtG community in decyphering the language, I decided to make a more organized and accessible version of the knowledge on the language
                (following versions 1 and 2 by Fernando Franco Felix, at HighlyEntropicMind on Youtube).
