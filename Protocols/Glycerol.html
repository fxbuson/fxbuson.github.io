<h1>Glycerol Stocks</h1>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
    Making glycerol stocks is our way of preserving any bacterial strains (plasmid-carrying or not) for the long-term.
    Stored at -80°C, these stocks will have the bacteria halt their metabolism, to be "re-started" later when we desire.
</p>
<p>
    Glycerol is necessary because water would normally form sharp crystals at -80°C, breaking the cell membrane and killing the cells.
</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ul>
    <li>From 100% glycerol, mix a desired volume with 1 molume of water to make 50% glycerol (it's hard to pipette the 100% accurately)</li>
    <li>Mix 500 uL of 50% glycerol with 500 uL of an overnight bacterial culture to get a 25% glycerol final concentration. Place at -80°C for storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Retreiving</h2>

<p>
    To retrieve a culture from a glycerol stock, the recommended method is plating the cells by streaking a small volume of the stock in solid media,
    then picking a colony to ensure genotype homogeneity (they all have the same DNA), then transferring to liquid culture if needed.
</p>
<p>
    Transfering the stock directly to liquid culture is also possible, assuming the stock is already clonal.
    However, this leaves opportunity for population heterogeneities to propagate or (in slower-growing bacteria) for contaminations to take over, so proceed with caution.
