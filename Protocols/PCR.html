<h1>PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)</h1>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
    PCR is a method used to amplify specific sections of a DNA sequence.
    It uses a heat-resistant DNA polymerase (DNAP), a pair of DNA oligonucleotides (primers) to define the amplicon and prime the reaction,
    and dNTPs (deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates: A, T, C, G) as substrates for the amplicon elongation.
</p>
<p>
    The reaction needs to cycle through three steps to copy a single DNA strand once:
    <ol>
        <li>Denaturation: heat to 95~98°C to de-hybridize the template DNA strand</li>
        <li>Annealing: cool down to the primers' melting temperature (Tm) to bind them to the template</li>
        <li>Elongation: heat to 72°C to allow elongation by the DNAP</li>
    </ol>
    The quick changes in temperature are made inside a thermocycler,
    and this normally is done 25~30 times with an initial longer denaturing step and a final longer elongation step.
    The products of a cycle serve as template for the next, ensuring geometric growth of the number of template DNA copies until dNTPs are depleted.

<h2>Q5 Polymerase protocol</h2>

<p>Q5 is a proprietary (NEB) high-fidelity DNAP used mostly for molecular cloning purposes.</p>

<h2>Primer Design</h2>

<p>
    There are some general best-practices when designing primers for PCR:
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid primer dimers and secondary structure. Use Thermo's <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/brands/thermo-scientific/molecular-biology/molecular-biology-learning-center/molecular-biology-resource-library/thermo-scientific-web-tools/multiple-primer-analyzer.html">Mutiple Primer Analyzer</a> for that.</li>
        <li>Aim for annealing regions around 20bp, with Tm around 60°C.</li>
        <li>Try to have the 3'-end of primers with a C or G.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        When using quick denaturing and annealing steps (~15s) it's useful to pay attention to the ramping times in your thermocycler.
        If it considers temperature ramping into the cycle time, you might not stay at the desired temperature for long enough.
    </li>
    <li>
        Template complexity matters a lot for appropriate PCR efficiency. Genomic templates might require extra time in all steps.
    </li>
