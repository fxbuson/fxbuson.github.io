<h1>PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)</h1>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
    PCR is a method used to amplify specific sections of a DNA sequence. It uses a heat-resistant DNA polymerase,
    a pair of DNA oligonucleotides to define the amplicon and prime the reaction, and dNTPs as substrates for the amplicon elongation.
