<h1>Felipe Xavier Buson</h1>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<div class="divider"></div>

<p>
    I am interested in the development of foundational tools for Synthetic Biology as a way of improving our ability to engineer life.
    Within this field, I would like to harness the potential of biological computation and genetic circuits to reliably control biological systems in increasingly complex networks.
    Recently I have also been particularly interested in synthetic biology part metrology, automation, and how the implementations of measurement standards can improve bioengineering.
